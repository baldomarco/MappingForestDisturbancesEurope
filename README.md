# European forest disturbance map

This repository holds data and code for producing forest disturbances maps across Europe using the LandTrendr disturbance detection algorithm. The maps are updated regularely and all updates to the code are documented in this repository. Note, however, that some data are very large and can't be distributed via GitHub. For detailed descriptions of the different versions, see following papers:

The disturbance maps produced in this research can be obtained under following link: https://zenodo.org/record/4570157#.YEPJTS337OQ or explored interactively using following web-mapping application: https://corneliussenf.users.earthengine.app/view/european-disturbance-map
